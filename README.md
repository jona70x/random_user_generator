Welcome to my fifth tech degree project: a random user generator.

This app uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and display them to the directory. 
When a card is clicked, it generates a modal window with the employee data. 
Project uses Google fonts.
