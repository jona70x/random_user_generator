Welcome to my fifth tech degree project: a random user generator.

This app uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and display them to the directory.
When a card is clicked, it generates a modal window with the employee data.
I change the font family of various elements using Google fonts
I have changed background color of the cards, body, and modal window.
